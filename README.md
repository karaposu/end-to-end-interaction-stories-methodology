# End-to-End Interaction Stories

## Overview

End-to-End Interaction Stories is a comprehensive methodology for documenting the complete interaction process of a feature or function in a software application. It extends traditional user stories by including detailed perspectives from both the client and server sides, as well as outlining the returned data and the final user action result. This approach ensures a thorough understanding of all aspects involved in a feature's implementation and helps in creating robust and user-friendly applications.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a structured format for creating End-to-End Interaction Stories, helping developers and stakeholders visualize the entire flow of user interactions from start to finish. This methodology is particularly useful for complex applications where understanding the full lifecycle of a user action is crucial.

## Structure of an End-to-End Interaction Story

Each End-to-End Interaction Story is divided into the following sections:

### Client-Side Story

1. **UI Layout Description (Technical)**
   - Provides a technical description of the UI layout, including component structures, placement, and any relevant styles or design patterns.

2. **UI-User Interaction Details**
   - Describes what the user sees and interacts with on the screen.
   - Focuses on the user experience (UX) aspects, such as the flow, responsiveness, and visual feedback.

3. **Client Action**
   - Specifies the input data provided by the user, the actions performed, and any front-end processing that takes place.

4. **Action Consequences - Visual**
   - Outlines the immediate visual consequences of the user’s action on the UI.
   - Describes changes in the UI, such as loading indicators, notifications, or updates to elements.

5. **Action Consequences - Internal and Data**
   - Explains the internal processing and data handling that occurs as a result of the user’s action.
   - Covers state changes, data validation, or temporary data storage on the client side.

6. **API Call**
   - Describes the API call made from the client side, including the endpoint, HTTP method, and any data sent with the request.

### Backend-Side Request Handling

1. **API Package Receive Logic**
   - Details how the API package receives the incoming request, including the initial parsing of the request data.

2. **API Data Auth and Sanity Check Logic**
   - Outlines the authentication processes and sanity checks performed on the received data to ensure it is valid and authorized.

3. **API Package Preprocessing Logic**
   - Describes any preprocessing logic applied to the data before it is handed over to the business logic layer, such as data transformation or enrichment.

### Backend-Side Business Logic

- **Details** the core logic applied to fulfill the request, such as database interactions, calculations, or specific rules that govern the feature.
- **Covers** any processing, data transformations, or decision-making steps the server performs.

### Backend-Side Response Preparation

- **Explains** how the server prepares the response that will be sent back to the client.
- **Includes** finalizing the data to be returned, formatting the response, handling errors, and setting the appropriate status codes.

### Returned Data Client-Side Story

- **Describes** the data or feedback returned by the server.
- **Explains** how the client processes the returned data and updates the UI.
- **Includes** error handling on the client side.

### User Action Result Story

- **Defines** the final outcome or state change resulting from the user's action.
- **Describes** any confirmation provided to the user and state changes in the application.
- **Mentions** any follow-up actions the user might take.

### Concerns

- **Identifies** potential issues, edge cases, or limitations related to the feature.
- **Discusses** how these concerns are addressed or mitigated.

### Requirements

- **Lists** the functional and non-functional requirements that must be met for the feature to be considered complete.
- **Ensures** that all dependencies, performance criteria, and compliance needs are documented.

## Documentation Guidelines

### Comprehensive Documentation

For each user story, an End-to-End Interaction Story must be created. This documentation should be thorough, covering all aspects from the initial client interaction to the final outcome. Every step should be clearly described to ensure that all team members understand the full interaction flow for the feature.

## Usage

To use this methodology in your project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create new End-to-End Interaction Stories by following the provided template for each feature or function.
3. Document the stories in a clear and concise manner, covering all sections thoroughly.
4. Share with your team to ensure everyone understands the full interaction flow for the features you're developing.

## Example Story

Here's a brief example of an End-to-End Interaction Story:

### Title: Register a New User

1. **Client-Side Story**
   - **UI Layout Description (Technical)**: The registration form layout with fields for email and password, including field validation rules.
   - **UI-User Interaction Details**: User views the registration form with input fields and a 'Register' button.
   - **Client Action**: User fills in the form with their email and password and clicks "Register".
   - **Action Consequences - Visual**: A loading spinner appears, and the 'Register' button is disabled until the process completes.
   - **Action Consequences - Internal and Data**: The email and password are validated on the client side, and the data is prepared for submission.
   - **API Call**: POST /auth/register
2. **Backend-Side Request Handling**
   - **API Package Receive Logic**: The server receives the POST request and parses the data from the registration form.
   - **API Data Auth and Sanity Check Logic**: The server checks if the email is unique and if the password meets security criteria.
   - **API Package Preprocessing Logic**: The server hashes the password before proceeding to business logic.
3. **Backend-Side Business Logic**
   - **Database Interaction**: Insert new user into the database.
   - **Business Logic**: Create a user record with the hashed password.
4. **Backend-Side Response Preparation**
   - **Response Preparation**: Return a success message.
5. **Returned Data Client-Side Story**
   - **Server Response**: {"message": "Registration successful"}
   - **Client Processing**: Display the success message to the user.
   - **UI Update**: Redirect the user to the login page.
   - **Error Handling**: Display an error if the registration fails.
6. **User Action Result Story**
   - **Outcome**: User account is created.
   - **Confirmation**: User sees "Registration successful" message.
   - **State Changes**: New user record in the database.
   - **Follow-Up Actions**: User can now log in with their new account.
7. **Concerns**
   - **Potential Issues**: Handling email duplicates or weak passwords.
   - **Mitigation**: Validate inputs and provide clear error messages.
8. **Requirements**
   - **Functional**: Must allow users to register with a valid email and password.
   - **Non-Functional**: Should complete the registration process in less than 2 seconds.
