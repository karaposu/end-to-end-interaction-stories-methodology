# End-to-End Interaction Stories

## Overview

**End-to-End Interaction Stories** is a comprehensive methodology for documenting the complete interaction process of a feature or function in a software application. It extends traditional user stories by including detailed perspectives from both the client and server sides, as well as outlining the returned data and the final user action result. This approach ensures a thorough understanding of all aspects involved in a feature's implementation and helps in creating robust and user-friendly applications.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a structured format for creating End-to-End Interaction Stories, helping developers and stakeholders visualize the entire flow of user interactions from start to finish. This methodology is particularly useful for complex applications where understanding the full lifecycle of a user action is crucial.

## Structure of an End-to-End Interaction Story

Each End-to-End Interaction Story is divided into the following sections:

1. **Client-Side Story**: 
   - Details what the user sees and interacts with.
   - Specifies the input data, actions performed by the user, and any front-end processing.
   - Describes the API call made from the client side.

2. **Backend-Side Request Handling**:
   - Outlines how the server receives and processes the incoming request.
   - Includes parsing the request, initial data validation, authentication checks, and any preparatory steps before business logic is applied.

3. **Backend-Side Business Logic**:
   - Details the core logic applied to fulfill the request, such as database interactions, calculations, or specific rules that govern the feature.
   - Covers any processing, data transformations, or decision-making steps the server performs.

4. **Backend-Side Response Preparation**:
   - Explains how the server prepares the response that will be sent back to the client.
   - Includes finalizing the data to be returned, formatting the response, handling errors, and setting the appropriate status codes.

5. **Returned Data Client-Side Story**:
   - Describes the data or feedback returned by the server.
   - Explains how the client processes the returned data and updates the UI.
   - Includes error handling on the client side.

6. **User Action Result Story**:
   - Defines the final outcome or state change resulting from the user's action.
   - Describes any confirmation provided to the user and state changes in the application.
   - Mentions any follow-up actions the user might take.

## Documentation Guidelines

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: For each user story, an End-to-End Interaction Story must be created. This documentation should be thorough, covering all aspects from the initial client interaction to the final outcome. Every step should be clearly described to ensure that all team members understand the full interaction flow for the feature.

## Usage

To use this methodology in your project:

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
2. **Create new End-to-End Interaction Stories** by following the provided template for each feature or function.
3. **Document the stories** in a clear and concise manner, covering all sections thoroughly.
4. **Share with your team** to ensure everyone understands the full interaction flow for the features you're developing.

## Example Story

Here's a brief example of an End-to-End Interaction Story:

**Title**: Register a New User

### 1. Client-Side Story
- **UI**: Registration form with fields for email and password.
- **Input Data**: `email`, `password`
- **Actions**: User fills in the form and clicks "Register".
- **API Call**: POST `/auth/register`

### 2. Backend-Side Request Handling
- **API Endpoint**: `/auth/register`
- **HTTP Method**: POST
- **Request Handling**: Server receives and parses the request.
- **Data Validation**: Check if the email is unique and password is valid.

### 3. Backend-Side Business Logic
- **Database Interaction**: Insert new user into the database.
- **Business Logic**: Hash the password, create a user record.

### 4. Backend-Side Response Preparation
- **Response Preparation**: Return a success message.

### 5. Returned Data Client-Side Story
- **Server Response**: `{"message": "Registration successful"}`
- **Client Processing**: Display the success message to the user.
- **UI Update**: Redirect the user to the login page.
- **Error Handling**: Display an error if the registration fails.

### 6. User Action Result Story
- **Outcome**: User account is created.
- **Confirmation**: User sees "Registration successful" message.
- **State Changes**: New user record in the database.
- **Follow-Up Actions**: User can now log in with their new account.
